This exceptional collection showcases four captivating Qawwalis. Multidisciplinary artist Babar Sheikh offers a unique perspective on the album in a special feature.There is something profoundly captivating about a lost record—a piece of art long-forgotten, shrouded in mystery, emerging from an unknown void after so many years. Its timing feels immaculate, as though it was destined to be revealed to the world at just the right moment. Last year, I first heard whispers of the discovery of forgotten recordings by Ustad <b>Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</b>.

    The story begins when Peter Gabriel’s Real World Records, internationally renowned for its contributions to world music, decided to relocate one of its studio storage facilities—a structure standing since the days of the Second World War. During this move, an employee uncovered recordings made in <b>1990</b> , produced by Michael Brook. These sessions, featuring Ustad <b>Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan</b>, his brother Farukh, and their Qawwali Party, were likely part of the same multiple recording sessions that gave birth to seminal fusion and traditional Qawwali albums, many of which the world has heard, while others, like these four, remained untouched.
    
    The album, Chain of Light (the title derived from the literal meaning of words from one of the devotional poems featured on this record), consists of four tracks: ‘Ya Allah Ya Rehman’, ‘Aaj Sik Mitran Di’, ‘Ya Ghaus Ya Meeran’, and ‘Khabram Raseed Imshab’. Hearing the samples for the first time during a pre-launch listening session left me in awe. The four tracks encapsulate the deep-rooted tradition of this devotional genre, and Khan Sahib, as always, gracefully makes each Kalam uniquely his own.

    <Ul><li><a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1237600-king-charles-gets-new-doctors-orders-ahead-of-australia-visit"><b>King Charles</b></a>


         is now being made to follow a new set of instructions in his routine as he continues his cancer treatment.

        The monarch, who is set to travel for his tour to Australia and Samoa this month, was forced to take up a habit which he has avoided in life, sources revealed.
        
        Doctors have instructed Charles to start eating lunch, which he had spent a lifetime skipping, a source told The Daily Mail.
        
        The King had always regarded the midday meal as a <b>“luxury”</b>  especially with his busy schedule. However, now that his body has a disease to fight and a heavy treatment to sustain, he needs a extra energy to keep going.
        
        Despite his hesitance, the monarch is begrudgingly following the doctors’ orders along with his wife Camilla’s.
        
        “With some reluctance, he now has something to eat at lunchtime —a snack, really,” the insider said. “He now eats half an avocado to sustain him through the day. It's important, particularly if you have got an illness.”
        
        Surprising, the meal choice has a unlikely connection to his daughter-in-law Meghan Markle, who previously dubbed the avocado as her “favourite foods.

    <H2><I><U>Sabrina Carpenter exposes 'false' claims about her career</U></I></H2>



    <p><ul><li><a href="https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/1237627-sabrina-carpenter-reveals-role-model-taylor-swifts-unexpected-guidance"> <b>Sabrina Carpenter</b></a>
         is clearing the air of any misperception about the singer’s songwriting prowess in response to people’s <b> ‘false’</b> claims.

        During her regal appearance on CBS This Morning, the Espresso and Please Please Please hitmaker addressed recent misconceptions about her music and songwriting skills.
        
        In response to a question about her <b> ‘clever’</b> lyrics, the  <b>25-year-old</b> laughingly said, "How much time do we have? I think a misperception is that I don't write my music. I think a lot of people think because I have, you know, a producer and co-writers that I love, that I'm sitting in the room on my phone, not writing songs."
        
        Carpenter further went on to add that she has co-written all of her recent songs after taking more than a decade to explode on the music scene.
        
        The former Disney star expressed gratitude toward her parents, Elizabeth and David Carpenter, who have stood by her through thick and thin.
